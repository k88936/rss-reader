<p>One of my favorite AI dev products today is <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14823-full-line-code-completion">Full Line Code Completion</a> in PyCharm (bundled with the IDE since late 2023). It’s extremely well-thought out, unintrusive, and makes me a more effective developer. Most importantly, it still keeps me mostly in control of my code. I’ve now used it in <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2025/01/23/you-can-just-hack-on-atproto/">GoLand</a> as well. I’ve been a happy JetBrains customer for a long time now, and it’s because they ship features like this.</p>
