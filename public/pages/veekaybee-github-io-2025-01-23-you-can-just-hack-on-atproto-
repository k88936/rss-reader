<p>Since I signed up for Bluesky last year,
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make something using the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a> that the platform is built on top of.</p>
<p>I finally had a chance to do it over the holiday break and built <a href="https://github.com/veekaybee/gitfeed">GitFeed</a>, a small Go app that filters the Bluesky network firehose by posts that have GitHub links and renders them into a refreshable, ephemeral feed.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.gitfeed.me/">see GitFeed here</a>, but it might not actually be running since I didn&rsquo;t build it for scale, and it&rsquo;s running on a tiny <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets">DigitalOcean Droplet</a> that&rsquo;s specced out at <code>1 GB Memory / 1 Intel vCPU / 35 GB Disk</code> , is entirely unloadbalanced, un-load-tested and has zero observability or alerting when my very scientific process of <a href="https://github.com/veekaybee/gitfeed/blob/main/.github/workflows/restart.sh#L11">running nohup fails.</a></p>
