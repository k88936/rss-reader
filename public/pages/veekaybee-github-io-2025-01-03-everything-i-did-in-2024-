<p>I want to get back into writing more regularly this year, so in light of that, here&rsquo;s my last year in review.</p>
<h1 id="evaluating-llms">Evaluating LLMs</h1>
<p>Like many of us in tech, I spent a large portion of 2024 thinking about and working with LLMs, but I was lucky enough to do it for work. I spent the year designing, building, open-sourcing, (and naming! 🐊) <a href="https://blog.mozilla.ai/lets-build-an-app-for-evaluating-llms/">an application to evaluate LLMs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-ai/lumigator">Lumigator.</a></p>
<p>In support of that work, I <a href="https://blog.mozilla.ai/open-source-in-the-age-of-llms/">did open-source work in the LLM ecosystem</a>and learned a ton of stuff along the way. Just when I thought I had <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2021/09/23/reaching-mle-machine-learning-enlightenment/">reached machine learning enlightenment</a>, I learned a ton about the weird <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2024/05/06/weve-been-put-in-the-vibe-space/">nondeterministic properties of LLMs</a>, their evaluation methods, Ray + Ray Serve, vLLM, Llamafile, <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2024/02/28/gguf-the-long-way-around/">GGUF</a>, FastAPI, OpenAPI-compatible APIs, and much, much, much more. I am hoping to translate some of these into blog posts as well.</p>
