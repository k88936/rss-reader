<p>There is a very vigorous debate happening online right now around what shape evaluation for LLM-based products should take. I don’t want to rehash all of it, other than saying that if you are building any applications with with non-deterministic components (most AI-powered apps), or applications that are data-intensive (also most AI powered apps!), and you are serious about these features in your application, you should at a very minimum be testing your online outputs in production on a daily basis. If offline testing (testing your given model outputs internally before it goes live in production) is a luxury you can also afford based on your engineering capacity and tooling maturity, even better!</p>
