<p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43332658">saw recently</a> that YCombinator celebrated its 20th anniversary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">Hacker News is slightly younger</a>, but to me the two go hand in hand.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, I actively started reading Hacker News around 2011. I don&rsquo;t remember how I heard about it. It was probably on Reddit or Digg. Once I found it, I started reading every day, mostly because the comment sections were so full of smart people in tech.</p>
