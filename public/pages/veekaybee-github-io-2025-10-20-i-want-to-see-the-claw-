<p>I respect quality software and the people who write it. And, I’ve invested years of my life in working on becoming one of these people (<a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2021/09/23/reaching-mle-machine-learning-enlightenment/">even if the journey has been long and hard</a> and has involved lots of YAML). I have seen and used code written by people who care about software correctness, who get pleasure out of defining correct interfaces, who have <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2025/09/09/walking-around-the-app/">walked the app</a>, who have spent years working towards mastery. And, I have seen and written the code the rest of us write.</p>
