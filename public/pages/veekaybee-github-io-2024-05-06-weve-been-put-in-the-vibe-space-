<p><a href="https://twitter.com/corychainsman/status/1786574177333334431">Jakob’s Law of UX</a> goes something <a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/">like this</a>. I, as a user online, spend my time on many sites. As such, when I come to your site, I am already used to the way the other sites work, and I don’t want to learn new paradigms. <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1786557956617601486">Some also call these preconceived notions</a> user mental models or affordances.</p>
<p>I like to call it the user-site contract.</p>
<p>For years, we have been conditioned to navigate sites along several axes as content consumers: along search and recommendations, and along ecommerce and social.</p>
