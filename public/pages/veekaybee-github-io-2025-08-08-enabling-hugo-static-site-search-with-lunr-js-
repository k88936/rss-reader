<p>There comes a time in every woman&rsquo;s life when she only wants one thing: for her mininmal static site to finally have some of the same features that dynamic blogging platforms do, namely search.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to tweak the results because the boosting is not quite where I&rsquo;d like it to be yet, but try it out!</p>
