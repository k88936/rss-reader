<p>I, like many developers who have worked on high-scale, low-latency web services over the last fifteen years, have an intimate relationship with Redis. At any new job, when you ask where the data is, and someone points you to a server address with port <code>6379</code>, you know you will meet an good, reliable friend there.</p>
<p>When you shell into the redis box or container or pod, you know what you’re going to find. When you run <code>redis-cli</code>, and it, immediately, presents you with the <code>&gt;</code>, you know you’re ready to work. And, when it returns <code>PONG</code> to your <code>ping</code>, you are filled with a sense of ritualistic completion and assurance that it is as ready to read your code as you are to write it.</p>
