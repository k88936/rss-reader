<p>edit: Huge thanks to Vamsi for digging into <a href="https://vamsiuppala.github.io/2024/03/15/speaker_recognition_and_translation.html">how to translate this into English!</a></p>
<p>I recently came across a really great Soviet video from 1971 called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF_%D0%B8_%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B5">&ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo;</a> (unfortunately only in Russian so far) where the creators examine how people react psychologically to different situations and how we see ourselves in light of a group.</p>
<p>In the introduction <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LYe58b-3HM">for example</a>, a professor starts giving a lecture, then a group of robbers storm in, fire fake guns, and take the professor away. Afterwards, the students have to recount what happened: i.e. how many robbers they were, what they did, what they were holding, etc, and a room full of people could not accurately paint a depiction of the entire scene, because, as the professor explains, we are prone to make mistakes, particularly if we are focused on something else.</p>
