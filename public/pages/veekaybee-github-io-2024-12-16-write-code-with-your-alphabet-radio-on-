<p>There is a lot of debate in the software community around whether LLMs can replace developers. Part of the reason is the way we formulate the problem of what it means to write software. In industry, we still give outsize cultural deference to software developers as lone wizards who come into the room, put on their hoodie, crank up the techno, and write the application on their own.</p>
<p>When we sit down at our keyboard, we assume that we sit down alone, with our precious treasure trove of programming knowledge that we have built up over the years, hoarding the nuggets about byte size and data types like a dragon guarding its gold. It is us and our hard-earned brain patterns from years of algorithm classes and hundreds of pages spent trawling StackOverflow versus the machine, working alone, against each other.</p>
